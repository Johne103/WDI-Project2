# Project #2: A Full-stack Application:                                                         CONQUIZTADOR - Playing for Global Domination


## Introduction

THE CONQUIZTADOR TEAM: Jamie Simpsonn, Luke Hammond, Gi, John Evans.

Conquiztador: a game in which a player takes on the role of a marval superhero to defend the world against evil super villains played by an AI, intent on taking control of the world, by conquering countries and overtaking terretories. Points are accumulated by correctly answering questions about the countries the adversaries are seeking to conquer.

### Overview

This project is **a full-stack RESTful application** that includes a **Google Map** a **Marvel and REST Countries API** and provision for  **User authentication**.

This solution is **built using an Express application** that has a **Mongo** database using the **Mongoose ORM**.

The solution has been developed by a team of four using Git in support of version control and output coordination. 

The solution has be developed with the use of tools such as Trello to support project planning and task coordination and the use of Balsamic wireframes aligned with the develepment of user stories outlining the expected users experience while using the app. The outcomes and scope of requirements have been prioritised using the MoSCoW technique. At the outset of the project the following prioritised requirements have been defined.

---

### Technologies Used

The app has employed the following Technologies:

* **Team Workflow using Git and GitHub** 
* **Node.js, Express.js, Morgan, Nodemon**
* **MVC**
* **RESTful routing** 
* **AJAX**
* **NoSQL with MongoDB backed Models and Mongoose**
* **Bcrypt, JWT, Encrypted Passwords and Authentication**
* **Gulp** 
* **OAuth and Third Party APIs**
* **SASS**
* **Wireframes using Balsamic**
* **Semantically clean HTML** 
* **Deployed online via Heroku** 

---

### Preparation


Use the information taught in module 2 of the WDI-23 programme.

Second project to create an application using frontend and backend technologies in order to develop an improved understanding of the approach required to create and deploy for general use a viable full stack apjplication, while working within a team.


* Conquiztadors is a **working full-stack application** game played against and AI. In order to win the player must answer as many questions correctly once they have selected a country to conquer. The AI will pick an alternate country and randomly select answers to gain points.

###The Steps taken

Initial planning using Trello, timeline, wireframes, developing game concept and gameplay rules, technologies to use, code testing, functionality tests and uploading to Git. Team approach to undertaking the 

Review of MoSCoW prrioritization and management of scope was a key aspect to achieving deliverables.


### Outline of Application Requirements and Prioritisation

__MUST HAVE Application Requirements:__

* Single player game. (MUST HAVE)
* On subsequent turn, player selects next country to conquer. (MUST HAVE)
* Player to conquer country and gain territory based on correct answer to at least 50 percent of questions about country. (MUST HAVE)
* For small countries 5 questions, medium 10 questions,large 40 questions to be answered rounds of 4. (MUST HAVE)
* Questions will start with facts such as flag, population range etc. and gain increasing difficulty. (MUST HAVE)
* Player will accumulate points for each correct answer. (MUST HAVE)
* Correct answer to question by player will be indicated by flag pinned within country representing player (MUST HAVE)
* Player answering all questionss correctly will take control of country and gain territory. (MUST HAVE)
* Player unable to answer all questions correctly will accumulate points but will not take control of country, but can move on to another country to try to take control by correctly answering all questions. (MUST HAVE)
* Player score and countries conquered will be displayed (MUST HAVE)

__SHOULD HAVE Application Requirements:__

* At start country to conquer is selected randomly. (SHOULD HAVE)
* Option for two player game on same device (SHOULD HAVE)

__COULD HAVE Application Requirements:__

* Colour of country respresentation on map to change colour to indicate conquered country for each player. (COULD HAVE)
* Option for two player game on seperate devices (COULD HAVE)
* Timer for answering each question. (COULD HAVE) 
* Use a marvel comics API , maybe the user could choose a superhero to play (user a) and a villain (user b) so it'd be good vs. evil world domination. (COULD HAVE)
* Saving game states to user profiles. (COULD HAVE) 

__WON'T HAVE Application Requirements (Out of Scope):__

* Application will not support use on smartphones. (WON'T HAVE)


The team subdivided the project deliverables into modules with a member of the four person team developing the solution for each module based on the MUST HAVE priorities identified.

Over the course of the project the requirements and prioritisation has been continuously reviewed and refined.


###Challenges faced

- Managing communications between team members in support of ensuring Git was correctly aligned with all updates.
- Resolving game question call function within quiz logic.
- Resolution of null fields in countries API dataset resulting in intermitent blank question pop up. 
- Issues with deployment of AI solution.
- Resolution of issues identified with Auth Key limits restricting access to Marvel API.
- Resolution of issues with registration and login functionality. 

###Where to from here?
The game could be improved in the following areas:

* The game has used some OOP functionaluty. Enabling full OOP will be a useful next step.
* Provisw the ability to have a second player on the same device or a seperate.
* Include audio themes depending on the super hero or villian selected.
* Include animation for selected super heros and villains.


###Bugs/Issues
- On occassions selecting a country to conquer displays a blank pop-up instead of a pop-/up with questions.




### Project Feedback + Evaluation - Key measures to be considered

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Deployment and Functionality__: Is your application deployed and functional at a public URL? Is your application free of errors and incomplete functionality?
